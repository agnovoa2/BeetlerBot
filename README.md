# KofiBot
KofiBot is a Telegram bot made in Python2.7 to send a particular message into a conversation. Its not meant to be use otside of my friend group, but in some way its interesting to have it in GitHub for the sake of future reference on how to make a Telegram Bot (?)

KofiBot uses [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) to work and it's pretty rudimentary.
